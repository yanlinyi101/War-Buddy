# Changelog

All notable changes to War Buddy are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project follows semantic versioning loosely — pre-1.0 minor bumps may break save-format or API assumptions.

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **SquadUnit puppets** — three blue capsule units spawn near the hero. They expose a method-level order interface (`order_move / order_attack / stop`) but do nothing on their own. Combat parameters mirror the hero (20 dmg, 0.75 s cooldown, 2.8 unit range). They have no HP and cannot die — invincible by design until the deputy AI lands.
- **SelectionSet** — `RefCounted` container of currently-selected squad units, with selection-ring visual feedback via `Decal`.
- **DevSquadController** (debug builds only) — drag-box left-click selection plus right-click move / attack orders. Provides the validation harness for the squad order interface ahead of Phase D's deputy execution. `OS.is_debug_build()` gates registration so release builds carry no dev surface.
- **HUD `DEV MODE` indicator** — orange top-right label visible only when the dev controller is active.
- **Tests** — five new GUT cases for SelectionSet plus four for SquadUnit (order interface, attack target lifecycle, selection-ring toggle). Total green count: 19.

### Notes
- No new autoloads. SelectionSet is held by reference from `bootstrap.gd`; `EventBus` / `CommandBus` / `GameState` remain deferred to Phase D when the deputy makes them necessary.
- The `Squad` named-group abstraction (spec 03 §7) is intentionally **not** yet introduced; v0.2 has only flat `SquadUnit` instances.
- Hero controls unchanged from v0.1.1. The LoL/WASD dual-input rework is captured in `docs/future-features.md`.

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- HUD `PanelContainer` no longer covers the 3D viewport or swallows mouse clicks. Added `mouse_filter = 2` and removed `size_flags_vertical = 3` so the panel sizes to its content instead of expanding across the screen. World orders now reach the ground / enemy buildings under the command-panel area as intended.
- Mouse-wheel zoom on the orthographic RTS camera now actually zooms by adjusting `Camera3D.size`. Previous code modified `position.y`, which only translates an oblique orthographic view diagonally — looked like a pan, not a zoom. `_adjust_zoom` now branches on `projection`; perspective fallback retained for future use.

### Docs
- Synced `docs/specs/02-rts-mvp-implementation-plan.md` checkboxes (T3–T6) with the v0.1.0 reality and the v0.1.1 patch.

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-04-23

First public cut of the RTS MVP commander slice, fully ported to Godot 4.6.x.

### Added
- **Commander-on-field gameplay loop** — single hero controlled by mouse, raycast-targeted move / attack, enemy building HP feedback, one-shot victory trigger when all three enemy buildings are destroyed.
- **Deputy command console** — two-channel (combat / economy) text command input with a lifecycle state machine (`submitted` → `received` → `pending_execution`) driven by `command_log_model.gd`.
- **Voice placeholder** — visible "Voice (Soon)" button that logs its click without pretending to record.
- **RTS camera** — WASD / screen-edge pan, middle-mouse drag, mouse-wheel zoom (`rts_camera.gd`).
- **Navigation** — `NavigationAgent3D` pathfinding with runtime-baked `NavigationRegion3D`; per-building `NavigationObstacle3D` so the hero actually routes around live buildings.
- **HUD input routing** — explicit `mouse_filter` pass on decorative Controls so clicks fall through to world orders; interactive controls block.
- **Destruction feedback** — 0.35s scale + alpha tween on `EnemyBuilding._destroy()`, with `destroyed` signal emitted before the tween so the victory check fires on the killing-blow frame.
- **`[RTSMVP]` debug log prefix** — every bootstrap, hero input, command, and victory event uses a common prefix for grep-friendly debugging.
- **Headless tests** — [GUT 9.6.0](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) addon at `godot/addons/gut/`, 10 cases covering command log submission/status lifecycle and match-state one-shot victory invariants.
- **CI/CD**
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — on every push/PR: headless boot + `SCRIPT ERROR` gate + GUT tests + docs-lint that forbids reintroducing Unity artifacts.
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` — on `v*` tag: matrix export for Linux / Windows / Web, attached to a GitHub Release.
- **Project docs** — `CLAUDE.md` at repo root, five-file `docs/specs/` set covering design, implementation plan, architecture reference, Unity parity outcome, and smoke-test checklist.

### Known issues / intentionally deferred
- **Multi-unit selection, drag-box, squads** — deferred to v0.2+.
- **Economy, workers, production queues, building placement ghosts** — out of scope for the commander MVP slice.
- **Voice input** — UI placeholder only; no real speech recognition.
- **Art assets** — everything is graybox. Visual pass is a v0.2+ concern.

### Migration note
The earlier Unity C# scaffold has been retired from this repo. Only engine-agnostic design text survives in the specs. See [`docs/specs/04-godot-unity-parity-checklist.md`](docs/specs/04-godot-unity-parity-checklist.md) for the close-out audit.
